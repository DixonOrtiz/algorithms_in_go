# Algorithms in Go :abacus:

There are many clasification to describe an algorithm, this project
implements clasification for **function** and clasification for **strategy**.

The idea is to learn different algorithms through the time and implement them
proggresively in this repository.

## Run algorithms :computer:

To run an algorithm it needs to start selection menu that lists different
algorithms. Command below:

```bash
go run main.go
```
