# Algorithms in Go :abacus:

There are many clasification to describe an algorithm, this project
does not implement any clasification for them.

The idea is to learn different algorithms through the time and implement them
proggresively in this repository.

## Test algorithms :computer:

To run an algorithm it needs to execute test files include in each algorithm module.
