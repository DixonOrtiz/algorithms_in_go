# Algorithms in Go :abacus:

There are many clasification to describe an algorithm, this project
implements clasification for **function** and for **strategy**.

The idea is to learn different algorithms through the time and implement them
proggresively in this repository.

## Test algorithms :computer:

To run an algorithm it needs to execute test files include in each algorithm module.
